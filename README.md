# Distem

Distem is a distributed systems emulator. When doing research on Cloud, P2P,
High Performance Computing or Grid systems, it can be used to transform an
homogenenous cluster (composed of identical nodes) into an experimental
platform where nodes have different performance, and are linked together
through a complex network topology, making it the ideal tool to benchmark
applications targetting such environments.

## Coding Style

* comments + commit messages in english
* documentation using rdoc
* indent with two spaces. With Vim, that does the trick:
```
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.rb set ts=2 expandtab sw=2
```
